# BuiltEnvironmentPlusCodeSnippets
All the custom code I was writing for Built Environment Plus's Website

2020 Internship code while working at BE+. I worked solo with a small team of other members who did other work within the organization. My job was to implement 
ideas that they had for the website, as well as fixing the existing UI.

I had only taken a single web development course before coming here. If I didn't know something, I figured it out, always bringing results to the table
. I feel as if my ability to learn new things quickly accelerated under this internship.

I was using WordPress and implemented my skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript w/ some JQuery
